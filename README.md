# GrubSlug
GrubSlug is a web-based marketplace designed to tackle the growing problem of food waste, particularly on university campuses. Every day, dining halls and students generate surplus food that is often discarded, contributing to environmental harm and missed opportunities for redistribution. GrubSlug offers a solution by allowing dining halls and students to sell leftover meals at reduced prices, reducing food waste and promoting sustainability.

In addition to minimizing waste, GrubSlug also provides a platform for students to sell their home-cooked meals, which they would typically sell over social media. This feature fosters community connection and contributes to social good, enabling students to share affordable, home-cooked food while reducing environmental impact.

Our project aligns with this year's theme of sustainability by addressing both environmental and social issues. It leverages technology to create a long-lasting solution that reduces waste, supports community collaboration, and promotes equitable access to food. GrubSlug is a forward-thinking approach to sustainability, transforming potential waste into affordable meals and fostering a more resourceful and connected campus.
