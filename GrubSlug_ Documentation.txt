Our future plans for GrubSlug include several enhancements to improve user experience. We will introduce live location tracking, allowing users to easily find nearby food offerings and foster a sense of community. Transforming GrubSlug into a mobile app will further enhance accessibility, enabling users to browse, communicate, and make purchases on-the-go.
Customizable user profiles will allow for profile picture uploads and showcase culinary creations, while image uploading for food will create a visually appealing marketplace. To incentivize participation, we will implement a point-based system, rewarding users for selling, purchasing, and engaging with the community.
Additionally, an email system and newsletter will keep users informed about new features, promotions, and tips for minimizing food waste. Together, these features will create a vibrant community dedicated to reducing food waste and promoting sustainability on campus.
